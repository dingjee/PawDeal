General rules

      In the following, we describe our general approach to coding videotaped negotiations with our coding scheme. This approach comprises the steps (a) unitizing, (b) coding, and, if appropriate, (c) splitting up codes. NegotiAct can be applied not only to the negotiation exchange itself, but also to the whole conversation that the negotiation is embedded in. As soon as negotiation parties first get in touch, for instance, by exchanging e-mails, or when entering the (virtual) room and until they leave again, the interaction can be coded.
Unitizing

      In a first step, everything that is said in a videotaped negotiation must be unitized in thought units (cf. Bales, 1950; Kauffeld & Lehmann-Willenbrock, 2012). One thought unit captures exactly one statement and, thus, represents the smallest meaningful segment of behavior that can stand alone (Bales, 1950). Usually, this is a single sentence that comprises or implies a subject and a predicate (Hatfield & Weider-Hatfield, 1978). However, it can also be one word (e.g., a "No" when rejecting an offer) or even a few sentences (e.g., when substantiating a position; see Table 1 for further examples). Only one statement should be captured with one thought unit, meaning that only one of the 47 codes can be assigned to one thought unit. Thus, a new thought unit must be parsed whenever one of the following situations is given: (i) The speaker changes. (ii) The speaker makes a new statement that contains a new thought within a speaking turn (e.g., first making an offer, then substantiating it). (iii) The speaker remains within the same code but expresses two different complete thoughts (e.g., voicing two different reasons for an offer in a row).

Table S1

Sample transcript with thought unit segmentation

SpeakerTranscriptBuyer"[For us, it's more important to agree on the price than on the contract

duration.] [What is more important to you?]"Seller"[The contract duration is also of less importance to us.]"Buyer"[Mm hmm.] [So how about we agree on 400.000€ and 2 years?]"Seller"[No,] [because...uh... eh....] [The problem is, we need to cover all the costs. We need to cover all the expenses.] [And we'd rather have a
longer contract duration.]"Buyer"[So you'd be happier with a contract duration of 10 years.]"Seller"[Yes, I..]"Buyer"[Wait.] [Me too.] [Hahahahaha.]"Seller"[Hahahaha.] [So, you also prefer 10 over 2 years?] [Then, let's agree

on 10 ten years.]"Buyer"[Yes, we can agree on that!] [Now, let's talk about the price.]Note. Words within square brackets indicate one thought unit. Coding
In a second step, one of the 47 codes is assigned to every thought unit (act-for-act-

coding). Additionally, the role of the person speaking is allocated to every thought unit (in solo-on-solo negotiation that would be A for one party and B for the other; in team-on-team negotiations with three negotiators per team, that would mean different persons for party A: A1, A2, A3,...; and also different persons for party B: B1, B2, B3...). If both/all negotiators are speaking at the same time, the role "all" must be assigned. If none of the negotiators are speaking but, for instance, an assistant or researcher, the code "Other noise" should be

applied. If none of the codes fit, the code "Others" should be applied. When in doubt, first decide which category the statement falls in and then choose the most appropriate code (see Figure S1).

Splitting up codes

      If the research question requires a more fine-grained analysis of certain behaviors (e.g., different types of humor), the codes in our coding scheme can be further split into more fine-grained codes (e.g., self-defeating or aggressive humor). A few examples are given in the following overview (e.g., for affective reactions or humor).

* 	"Then, thank you very much."Also: If negotiators advocate for the other party (e.g., "If we ask for a higher price, this would of course be worse for you."), agree with their substantiation (e.g., "Yes, indeed, yes, that's correct."), or show empathy "I understand that this is hard for you."Negative relationship remarkStatements that reflect a negative relationship between the parties* "I feel like we're not on the same page."
* "Well, I can't take your word for it, can I?"
* "You don't seem comfortable discussing this with me."Not: "I feel like you're lying to me." (Criticism) And also not: "I'd rather not tell you precise numbers." (Avoiding)Personal communicationAsking the other party for personal information that is not related to the negotiation or providing the other party with personal information not
related to the negotiation* "So you like playing chess?"
* "So, do you like strategic games?"
* "I'm really into cars."

CodeDefinition/contentExampleDelimitAdditional informationNonpersonal chit- chatMiscellaneous statements unrelated to negotiation
e.g. remarks about the weather* "Hello, welcome.."
* "It's getting very chilly these last days."

Unethical behaviors

CodeDefinition/contentExampleDelimitAdditional informationOmission*Withholding information which was explicitly requested by the other party or concealing indifference/compati bility toward options (misrepresentation by omission)* "If we agree on the supplier you prefer, you have to accommodate on the price" (using a compatible issue [i.e. the supplier] for a trade-off)
* Can we agree on purchasing the buffer tank right away if we decide for the longest contract duration?" (using a compatible issue [i.e. contract duration] for a trade-off)Also: Paltering (using truthful statements to create a false impression), e.g., "You decided fully on the contract duration, so we want to decide who's responsible for the construction of the gateway cooling system" - leaving the impression that the first decision was not in line with the negotiator's preference, even though it was (compatible issue)
Not: "I'd rather talk about something else" (Avoiding);
And also not: Answering "a lot" or "probably more than you would have to pay" to the question "How much precisely does the construction of the cooling system cost
                                                 you?" (Avoiding)	*Can only be coded when coders have required information (e.g. instructions, payoff schedule).
For further analyses the code that would have been assigned if behavior was not an Omission can be written down (comment section or additional code).

CodeDefinition/contentExampleDelimitAdditional informationThreatWarning of the costs if other party does not comply with made propositions,
e.g. giving the other party an ultimatum* "Well, if you can't go any higher, you won't get the chance to talk about the other issues at all."
* "If you don't collaborate, it will be much harder for you to get what you want from me."
* "We can also leave it and you
don't get the pump head at all."Also: "If you don't agree in the next minutes, you'll leave with nothing."
Not: "I don't need you. I have other options" (Stressing power)
And also not: "This is my limit, I won't lower the price anymore" (Positional commitment)Lying*Misrepresenting by commission,
e.g. misrepresenting one's preferences, pretending to be obliged to consult with a third party* "This is really important to us." (even though it is not)
* "I don't know." (even though the negotiator knows the answer to the specific question the other party asked)
* "We have a much higher offer from a different company." (even though the party does not have a higher alternative offer)*Can only be coded when coders have required information (e.g. instructions, payoff schedule).
For further analyses (to see what negotiators lie about) the code that would have been assigned if behavior was not Lying can be written down (comment section or
additional code).

CodeDefinition/contentExampleDelimitAdditional informationHostilityUse of indecent language directed at the other party, teasing and provoking or directly insulting the other
party* "This sounds a bit childish."
* "Why are you so wimpy?"
* "Bullshit!" (for assigning this code, this utterance must be directed at the other party)Use of extreme anchors*Making an offer that is far greater than the other party's reservation pointIf one of the following applies:
* a) The offer exceeds twice as much as the differences between the options of a (fixed-steps) payoff schedule above the upper limit/below the lower limit.
Example:*Can only be coded when coders have required information (e.g. instructions, payoff schedule).Maintenance agreement	Score A	Score B24 months	0	320018 months	200	240012 months	400	16006 months	600	800no maintenance included	800	0Party B offers 37 months* b) The offer exceeds twice as
much as the space between both parties' reservationpoints above/below the other party's reservation point.

Acts of process-related communication

CodeDefinition/contentExampleDelimitAdditional informationProcedural suggestionCommenting on the mode, approach or process of the negotiation or suggesting an action or a course of action regarding the process of the interaction* "Then let's start with negotiating about the price, shall we?"
* "What I'd suggest is that we put the financial subsidy on hold until the end of the negotiation."
* "There are still a few open issues on which we have to agree."Also: "So, we're done!" And also: "It's difficult to find an agreement."
Not: "It's difficult to go any higher." (Positional commitments)If the research focus is on procedural suggestions, this code can be split up in different kinds of procedural suggestions, e.g.,
* Suggesting to discuss one issue at a time
* Suggesting to do package trade- offs
* Positive comments on process
* Negative
comments on processProcedural discussionAgreeing, disagreeing, clarifying, or asking for clarification regarding a procedural suggestion/comment* "Right, let's do that."
* "So, you mean discussing issue X first?"
* "What other issues are there to discuss?"
* "We skipped talking about the tank so far, right?"Not: "We still have two issues to discuss." (Procedural suggestion)

CodeDefinition/contentExampleDelimitAdditional informationTime managementTime checks, remarks about time that is running-out and suggestion to hurry and come to quick solutions* "With regards to the time, we should better find a quick solution." (make sure when assigning this code that the negotiator includes himself/herself when pointing out to hurry)
* "Can you watch the time? I'm not wearing a watch."
* "We still have 10 minutes."Not: Putting time pressure on the other party as a means of distributive bargaining, e.g., "With regards to the time, you should better agree to my proposal." (Substantiation)Change of modeChanging the mode of discussion, for instance, by using visual aids (e.g.
Whiteboard, pen and paper, Excel-sheet), by suggesting a break to calculate, think, or consult with the own party, or when changing the mode of communication* "One moment, I have to think about this."
* Negotiators then read their materials or take notes.
* Negotiators use a whiteboard or a piece of paper to illustrate something.
* Negotiators move from e-mail to negotiating live (time in between the last e-mail and first contact in person)
* Time in between communication via e-mailAlso: Negotiator reads out instructions aloud
Not: "I'd rather think about this a little more" (Avoiding)If the research focus is on change of mode, this code can be split up in different kinds of actions, e.g.,
* Reading materials
* Changing the mode of communication
* Using a whiteboard or a piece of paper to illustrate something
* Announcing a break for consulting with the own party
* Remark about
having to contemplate

Residual category

CodeDefinition/contentExampleDelimitAdditional informationInterruption of the conversationExternal or internal issues that disrupt the interaction (e.g., traffic noise, coughing, or
sneezing)* One of the negotiators sneezes or coughs
* Someone enters the room.InactionStatements that are aborted without being interrupted by the other party* "Yes, so we can...ah..hmm..."
* "Or maybe if you...ah..no..."
* "Yeah, but...(nothing follows)"Not: "Ah, hmm" in response to the other's statement (Active listening)OthersAll statements that do not fit within any of the categories* Humming, while thinking
* Silence
* Incomprehensible speechNot: Silence because negotiators take notes or read the material (Change of mode)
And also not: People start a sentence with "Uhhh" but do not finish

To illustrate the inner workings of lag sequential analysis you will find the respective formulas below that allow following the single steps for each calculation mathematically (see Bakeman & Gottman, 1997).
(1) The estimate of transition probabilities (tGT) is calculated as follows (Bakeman & Gottman, 1997; p. 98):

??????

= ??????
????+

(1)


Note. xGT = observed frequency value (i.e., how often behavior T followed behavior G); xG+ = frequency of behavior G in total


(2) The estimate of expected frequencies (mGT; i.e., chance joint frequency) is calculated as follows (Bakeman & Gottman, 1997, p. 108):

??????

= ????+*??+??
??++

(2)


Note. xG+ = frequency of behavior G in total; x+T = frequency of behavior T in total; x++ = total number of thought units - number of interactions


(3) Z-values are calculated as follows (Bakeman & Gottman, 1997, p. 109):

??????

= 	??????-??????	
v??????*(1-????+)*(1-??+??)

(3)


Note. xGT = observed frequency value (i.e., how often behavior T followed behavior G); mGT

= estimate of expected frequencies; pG+ = frequency of behavior G in total/total number of thought units - number of interactions; pT+ = frequency of behavior T in total/total number of thought units - number of interactions
